Three Essentials: How a Neuroscientist with 20 Years of AI Research Uses ChatGPT

The video features Professor Kim discussing the importance of AI.
His main idea is that we have to use it wisely and get variety experience with it.
he also talks about the development and history of AI, how it has improved so rapidly and how it affects our lives

In fact we have so many convenient with AI likes GPT, It can help our daliy life image, video, etc... 
Beyond it threaten our job actually many developer and coder now losing their job

The most important thoughts that come to my mind while i watchcing the video are as follows..

First of all, as Professor Kim says, we have to gain various experiences and develop our ability to use AI effectively.
Second, we need to think about our own brain 
many people rely on AI too much, which causes a lack of creativity, problem solving ability, and critical thinking.
We cannot stop using AI, but we should never lose our ability to think, question, and creativity.
Similarly, Professor Kim also mentioned that to use AI effectively, we have to choose the best option that made by AI, 
and to do that, they must have a proper understanding of it(AI).

However in Korea we have a poor environment for developing AI infrastructure because of insufficient resources and an underdeveloped educational foundation.
in my opinion, in such a difficult environment, we must find what we can do. and constantly looking for ways that we can survive and more forward within the given cirumstane/

Lastly, professor Kim say that choosing the best result amont these created by AI is a matter of human judgment.
i believe this judgment is not only a skill and advancing in the era of Ai, but also a reminder that we must rely on our own power rather than someones else's decisions.
In a broader sense, it can even serve as a guiding principle for life.

Additionally, i think we are now living on  an era where anyone can achieve what they want throughthe development of Ai.
i hope htis advancement becomes an opportunity to turn potential crises into even greater possibilities.
